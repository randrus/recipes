# polenta

## Overview.

Traditional basic polenta, with feta. 

Because of course feta.

## Ingredients
* coarse corn meal
* feta cheese

## Preparation

Boil some water. Maybe two cups?

Once it's boiling, start stirring in corn meal. I use a very strong stiff steel 
whisk but a spoon would probably work. It will start to thicken up soon, and it will
be boiling too - which means blops of super heated sticky cornmeal will be flying 
around - so you need to protect yourself. Long sleeves, maybe gloves.

Stop adding before it gets too thick (it will end up thicker than you want, probably).

Add feta to taste.
