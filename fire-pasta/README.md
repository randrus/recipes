# Fire Pasta

## Overview

This is a favorite in my house, where our motto is "everything is betta with feta".

It's quick and easy and visually appealing.

I devised this in my bachelor days (surprise) and called it "mush" or "moosh", but my son 
rebranded it as "Fire Pasta". Seems suitable, given the coloring.

## Ingredients
* 1 lb feta cheese (block)
* 3 bell peppers (red, orange, yellow)
* 1 box tri-colored rotini 

For the feta - dry and firm is good. Trader Joe's feta is excellent and a good bargain. 

I've only ever used cows milk feta for this.

## Preparation
* Start boiling water for the pasta.
* Cut the peppers into little chunks - 1/2" square or so.
* Cut the feta into 1/2 cubes

Once water is boiling, dump in the pasta. I like to add a little olive oil to 
the water before the pasta - seems like it might keep it from sticking to itself
so much. Stir the pasta to prevent clumping.

Once the pasta is al dente, toss in the peppers and allow them to cook a little. 

Dump into a big collander and shake out the water. Dump back into the pot. 

Add feta and stir it up. Serve in bowls once the feta is melty. Black pepper optional.
