# Samcakes
Thanks to Aunty Splash

## ingredients
* 1 cup flour
* 2 tbs sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 egg
* 1 cup milk
* 2 tbsp butter


## Preparation
* melt the butter
* combine dry ingredients
* add milk to desired consistency
* add butter last
* pour out 1/2-1 cup portions on to med-high griddle. cook until little bubbles form, then flip over and cook about the same time

## Notes
* I've been using a cast iron griddle for some time, but a non-stick pan works too - you should need less butter though.
* If you want blueberries or chocolate chips, you can add to the batter or to the cooking pancake once on the griddle - both are good, but different
* To add bananas, either add as slices to the mix once on the grill, or mash and mix into batter. Both are good, but different.
